# PyMikor

Python package for a numerical evaluation of multidimensional integrals with constant limits of integration by the [Korobov's method](http://wwwinfo.jinr.ru/programs/jinrlib/d121.htm).
The `PyMikor` package provides few comparisons with other standard numerical methods.

The algorithm is described in *Numerical multidimensional integration with PyMikor*, by E. Barto≈° (Comp. Phys. Comm. 270 (2022) 108149, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108149))
